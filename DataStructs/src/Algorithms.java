	 * sub array would be 0 to list.length - 2. We then move the largest element
	 * to what index of i for that particular iteration. In that same example we
	 * we would move the largest element to the index list.length - 1
	 * 
	 * <p> we move the largest element by constantly swapping elements when
	 * the element at j is > than the element at j + 1. This in turn will take
	 * the largest element an place it at the end
	 * 
	 * <p> the variable lastSwapindex is used to ensure that we don't waste
	 * resources checking already sorted elements. When we make a swap the variable
	 * gets sets to what j + 1 is as it will be decrement in the next iteration 
	 * making it j then we move the next largest element up to j

	/**
	 * 
	 * <p> Quicksort works by taking a look at a given subarray 
	 * from the index i to j. From the given subarray we find a pivot
	 * element that will be used in the partition method. (in this 
	 * implementation it is the middle of the sublist) After we have 
	 * the index of the pivot element we then swap it with the 
	 * element at the end of the sub array. After the sway the pivot
	 * element is at the end of the subarray and i to j - 1 contains
	 * all other elements of the sublist
	 * 
	 * <p>then the list, i, j - 1, and the pivot element are passed
	 * into the partition method. We pass j - 1 because the index j
	 * is where the pivot is. In the partition method we move left and right
	 * pointers towards each other until they cross. Before they cross
	 * we first move the left pointer right until we find an element 
	 * greater than the pivot.  Then the right index moves left
	 * until it finds and element less than the pivot
	 * once they find them the swap. This happens until left and right 
	 * pass each other then the left index is return. The left index is now
	 * the sorted position of the pivot. once we return from the partition
	 * function we swap k with right (k is the sorted pos of the pivot and 
	 * right is the index that has the pivot element) Then we call quicksort 
	 * on the left part of k and right part of k and the process repeats
	 * 
	 * <p>if left doesnt find an element greater than the pivot then 
	 * the left pointer will stop once it hits right + 1 as that is the 
	 * variable j from the calling function which is the pivot then the next
	 * while loop will stop as left is >  right and no swap occurs then the 
	 * overall loop terminates and we return left we than swap k with right which 
	 * point to the same index meaning that the picot was already in its sorted positino
	 * 
	 * <p> if right doesnt find an element smaller than the pivot than it will do 
	 * the same thing as the above paragrpah only this time it moves left and the
	 * loop terminates since left is > right than the pivot is swapped with k which is the
	 * begging of the subarray meaning that the beginign was the sorted pos of the pivot
